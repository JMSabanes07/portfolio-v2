      Hi! I'm <strong>Juan Manuel Sabanes</strong>, a frontend developer with experience in building
      web and Android applications using technologies like ReactJS, React Native, and Next.js. I
      specialize in functional and efficient development, focusing on creating robust and scalable
      solutions while leaving the design work to the experts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about solving problems and see programming as a way to combine creativity and
      logic to bring great ideas to life. My goal is to be part of unique creations that make a
      difference in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Iâ€™m a huge fan of video games and hope to one day take my passion for gaming to
      the next level by developing games of my own.
